# UI-TEST

## Overview

Our client's app Rule of Thumb™️ tracks the sentiment of their users on trending and controversial people from different fields, including politics, business, media and entertainment, etc. The website has the following requirement: they need to present their users with an easy way to share their opinion on each presented celebrity, using votes (thumbs up and down), and display the results to the user while the poll is open. These features should be available to all users, regardless of where they're accessing the website from, whether it's a smartphone, a tablet or a desktop computer.
